# YearEnRoute Travel Recap | TAMUHACK2020

Our devpost submission can be found here: https://devpost.com/software/american-airlines-yearenroute-travel-recap

## Inspiration
We were motivated by the need for wanting to be able to see past flights taken and be able to have easy access to their points earned, miles traveled and frequently visited places. Our primary inspiration was also trying to come up with a visual experience for users to relive their travels.

## What it does
Our web application is designed based on the current American Airlines mobile app, with an extra feature of "Past Flights". This feature allows you to be able to see a year worth of flight history, miles, points earned and a video recap of places they journeyed to. The video recap starts off with a time-lapse showcasing different places and cultures around the world followed by symbolic pictures of your traveled to places.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges with React.js trying to connect it to what we were trying to accomplish. The API we were given did not have the data for Users' flight history and information that we needed. Hence, we shifted to a more UI based approach to mimic our potential design and plan. We also had some issues with scaling the website to different sized screens. Another challenge we ran into was that about a half an hour before the submission was some of our Github branches didn't merge correctly and resulted in lost data and disarrayed design. We were able to get a previous version working and fix this issue just in time.

## What's next for American Airlines | YearEnRoute Travel Recap
We want to be able to use actual user data and populate this to create a wholesome user experience that can be shared on various social media platforms.
